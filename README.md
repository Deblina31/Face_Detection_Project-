# Face Detection using OpenCV and Python

## 📚 Project Description

+ This project is a face detection system built using OpenCV and Python.
+   The system identifies and recognizes specific celebrities' faces from images.
+    The project leverages pre-trained models for facial recognition, showcasing almost accurate results.

## 🚀 Features
+ Celebrity Face Detection: Identifies specific celebrities' faces.
+ Image Processing: Detects faces in static images.
+ Pre-Trained Model: Uses a pre-trained model i.e Haar- Cascade Classifier for face recognition.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
+ OpenCV: For computer vision tasks and image processing.
+ Python: The programming language for implementing the detection logic.
+ Pre-trained Model ( Haar- Cascade Classifier): For recognizing faces.
+ NumPy: For efficient matrix and array manipulations.

## 🚧 Future Improvements
+ Add more celebrities to the detection list.
+ Improve accuracy and speed with further model optimization.
+ Integrate Deep Learning models for even better face recognition.

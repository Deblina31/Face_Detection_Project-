Face Detection using OpenCV and Python

📚 Project Description

This project is a face detection system built using OpenCV and Python. The system identifies and recognizes specific celebrities' faces from images.
The project leverages pre-trained models for facial recognition, showcasing almost accurate results.

🚀 Features
Celebrity Face Detection: Identifies specific celebrities' faces.
Image Processing: Detects faces in static images.
Pre-Trained Model: Uses a pre-trained model i.e Haar- Cascade Classifier for face recognition.

🛠️ Technologies Used
OpenCV: For computer vision tasks and image processing.
Python: The programming language for implementing the detection logic.
Pre-trained Model ( Haar- Cascade Classifier): For recognizing faces.
NumPy: For efficient matrix and array manipulations.
